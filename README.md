# Signature Verification using Few-Shot Learning with Siamese Networks

This project implements a signature verification system using few-shot learning techniques with Siamese networks and triplet loss. The system is designed to verify whether a given signature is real or fake based on a limited number of reference samples.

## Overview

Signature verification is an important task in various domains, including banking, security, and forensics. Traditional methods often require a large number of labeled samples for training, which can be impractical in real-world scenarios. Few-shot learning techniques address this limitation by learning from a small number of examples.

## Approach

The project adopts the following approach for signature verification:

1. **Siamese Networks**: Siamese networks are used to learn a similarity function between pairs of signatures. These networks consist of twin networks with shared weights, which learn to embed input signatures into a common feature space.

2. **Triplet Loss**: Triplet loss is employed as the training objective for the Siamese network. The loss function encourages the network to minimize the distance between genuine signatures while maximizing the distance between genuine and forged signatures.

3. **Few-Shot Learning**: The system is trained to verify signatures with only a few reference samples. During inference, it compares a test signature with the reference samples and computes a similarity score to determine whether the signature is genuine or forged.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of genuine and forged signatures for training and evaluation. The dataset comprises a variety of signature styles and degrees of forgery to ensure robustness and generalization of the model.

## Usage

To use the signature verification system:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare a dataset of genuine and forged signatures. Ensure that each signature is labeled accordingly.

2. **Model Training**: Train the Siamese network using triplet loss on the prepared dataset. Fine-tune the model to achieve optimal performance.

3. **Inference**: During inference, provide a test signature along with a small number of reference samples. Compute the similarity score between the test signature and each reference sample to determine the authenticity of the signature.
